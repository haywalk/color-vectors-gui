# color-vectors-gui
A graphical version of the command line program I wrote to perform linear transformations on images.
You can read about the original program and results
[on my website](https://www.haywalk.ca/math/colours-as-vectors.html).

## Usage

This program is still a work in progress and I haven't even got a proper build yet. It requires
JavaFX and its associated compile and run commands. The
main class is `MatrixGUI`.
